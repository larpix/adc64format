adc64format
-----------

This is a script and library to help interfact with the ADC64 format.

To install::

    pip install adc64format

To dump the contents of a single ADC64 file to an HDF5 format::

    adc64_to_hdf5.py <number of samples> <input ADC64 file>.data <output HDF5 file>.h5

To use interactively or within another python codebase::

   from adc64format import dtypes, skip_chunks, parse_chunk, ADC64Reader

   # Option 1: Parse a single event from an ordinary file object
   with open('<ADC64 file>.data', 'rb') as f:
   
       # Load the first event
       chunk = parse_chunk(f)

       # Look at chunk data (as numpy arrays)
       for key in dtypes:
           print(chunk[key])

       # Skip N events
       n = 100
       skip_chunks(f, n)
       chunk = parse_chunk(f)


   # Option 2: Parse events from multiple files and align by timestamp
   with ADC64Reader('<ADC 64 file from ADC 0>.data', '<ADC 64 file from ADC 1>.data', ...) as reader:
       batch_size = 10 # how many events to load on each iteration
       events = reader.next(batch_size)
       
       # get matched events between multiple files
       events_file0, events_file1, ... = events

       # Look at data
       for key in dtypes:
           print(events_file0[key])
